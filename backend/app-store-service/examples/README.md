# Example Applications

[This directory](https://github.com/SDU-eScience/UCloud/tree/master/backend/app-store-service/examples) contains a
number of example applications that can be used during development. You can upload them to your local UCloud instance
by going to the __Admin__ (Found in the sidebar) âž¡ __Application Studio__. From here you should start by uploading the
tools, which in the directory are suffixed by `-tool.yml`. Once you have uploaded the tools you can upload the
applications. You can read more about how applications work [here](../README.md).

Once the applications have been uploaded, you should be able to use them from the UCloud interface. If you want them
to appear directly in the __Apps__ section, you must go into each application and add the `Featured` tag to them.
